  "copy": "I'd love to pass on some info about an awesome opportunity for businesses to increase support for women who choose to pump breast milk at/during work. The number of women returning to paid work after having children has nearly DOUBLED in the past 40 years and those women are increasingly setting goals to breastfeed for at least a year; this trend is creating a growing pumping workforce. Lactation support programs are proven to increase the chance that our talented women will return to us. The research behind this is stunning, showing a 35 percentage point increase in employees returning to work at companies with lactation support programs. The best part is this is a true win-win; the American Academy of Pediatrics reports that for every dollar we spend on lactation support, we can expect a 300% return.\r\rProud Ounces is on a mission to make pumping & working easy for moms and the employers that support them. They have a program allowing employers to offer the Proud Ounces Pump Coaching service as a benefit to employees returning to work after the birth of a new baby. One pump coaching session gives a mom the information and confidence to be a pumping and working pro on the first day back at work. 100% of participants say the session significantly increased their confidence that they will be successful returning to work and continuing to breastfeed."
