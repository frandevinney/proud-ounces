### Providing space is essential for the pumping & working mom

A pumping & working mother needs a private space because, in many cases, she will undress from the waist up in order to pump breast milk. When it comes to needed privacy, don’t confuse the act of breastfeeding a baby with the act of pumping breast milk. Breastfeeding in public is encouraged and even protected by law. For a woman who desires to, there are many strategies to limit exposure while breastfeeding. Eliminating exposure while pumping is more difficult and don’t even get us started on the immense list of tools and accessories needed to accomplish the act of getting breast milk from the body to a bottle or bag without the help of the actual baby. The act of a baby suckling at the breast is what signals the body to produce and release the milk (makes sense, right?) so a breast pump and the myriad of accessories that go with it are designed to imitate the baby in his or her absence. Suffice to say, it’s not an easy process and even after she accomplishes the miracle of expressing the milk, she’ll need more accessories to perform the science experiment of transferring milk and then cleaning and potentially sterilizing everything for transport home or the next pumping session.
