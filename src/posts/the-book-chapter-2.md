Based on the process described above, you can understand why a mom would want to be confident that the space is private and secure. Federal law states that the space should be “free from intrusion from coworkers and the public.” To put yourself in her shoes, imagine how comfortable you would feel changing your own clothes in the space you have planned to designate for pumping. Now imagine that you would need to stand in the room undressed for 20 minutes. A lock on the door sounds pretty important, right? When you create your spaces, take yourself back to the place of being naked in the room while you consider all possible ways someone could enter that room (maintenance workers with universal access, colleagues, or other pumping moms) then eliminate those weak points.
